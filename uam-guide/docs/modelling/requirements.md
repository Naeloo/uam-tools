# Requirements

## Blender

For preparation, you'll need Blender. This guide tries to assume no familiarity with
Blender, but it is advantageous to know your way around the software.
You can find some basic tutorial videos by the Blender foundation [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLa1F2ddGya_-UvuAqHAksYnB0qL9yWDO6). This guide focuses on Blender 2.8+, which had some major
interface changes - if you look up any tutorials, make sure they're for that version.

## OpenSCAD

OpenSCAD is used to generate various CAD models for connectors and features, in order to be able to generate ones of appropriate size
for different airways. Any recent version should do, the version everything was tested on is 2021.01. Previous experience with OpenSCAD
is not really required, as usage just involves playing with model parameters and not modelling itself, unless you want to create
new features.
