# Requirements

## Blender

For preparation, you'll need Blender. This guide tries to assume no familiarity with
Blender, but it is advantageous to know your way around the software.
You can find some basic tutorial videos by the Blender foundation [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLa1F2ddGya_-UvuAqHAksYnB0qL9yWDO6). This guide focuses on Blender 2.8+, which had some major
interface changes - if you look up any tutorials, make sure they're for that version.
