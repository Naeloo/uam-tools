# Upper Airway Modelling Guide

## Description

Welcome to the upper airway modelling guide. This guide was created to assist in creating physical models of upper airways
by segmenting CT imagery and manipulating that mesh to finally create a printed physical model of an upper airway with various
connection points for testing and measuring. It was created as a result of a group project in the PRT2 course of the Master's degree of Medical
Engineering & eHealth at UAS Technikum Wien. It is the culmination of tons of trial & error in order to make the life of future airway modellers
easier - we hope it can assist you in your endeavours.

## Structure

This guide is structured into 3 main areas; Segmentation, Modelling and Printing. If you're starting with a raw set of CT data,
you will want to start at "Segmentation - Loading Data". If you already have an airway mesh, you can jump straight into modelling or printing,
depending on what you want to do.
